# Database partitioning is a technique where you split up a huge table into multiple tables and let the database decide which table
  or which partition to hit based on the where clause.

# partitioning :- helps to to avoid querying huge amount of data and work with smaller set of data.

# using an index or full table scanning 100 million row is a lot,that's going to slow things down.
   Index large tables are always slow to query regardless.So what do we do? Partitioning is the idea here is
   break the table down to smaller pieces so we know we only work with so many rolls and instead of a larger set of rules.

 # The quickest way to query a table with a billion rows is to avoid querying a table with a billion rows with the help of Partitioning.

Vertical and Horizontal Partitioning 

Horizontal Partitioning :-  Split table based on rows [Using list or range]
Vertical Partitioning :- Split table based on column. Ex. Large column (Blob)
